"This is intended for use with the Sphinx autodoc tool, to be run near the "

"will have full access to the \"real\" function, in terms of function "
"signature and so forth. Without use of ``unwrap_tasks``, autodoc is unable "
"to access the function signature (though it is able to see e.g. "
"``__doc__``.)"

"You can go above and beyond, and explicitly **hide** all non-task functions,"

"autodoc to skip over them."
