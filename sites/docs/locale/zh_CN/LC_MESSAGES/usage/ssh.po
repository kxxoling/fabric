msgid ""
"Fabric currently makes use of a pure-Python SSH re-implementation for "
"managing connections, meaning that there are occasionally spots where it is "
"limited by that library's capabilities. Below are areas of note where Fabric"
" will exhibit behavior that isn't consistent with, or as flexible as, the "
"behavior of the ``ssh`` command-line program."

#: ../usage/ssh.rst:15
msgid ""
"SSH's host key tracking mechanism keeps tabs on all the hosts you attempt to"
" connect to, and maintains a ``~/.ssh/known_hosts`` file with mappings "
"between identifiers (IP address, sometimes with a hostname as well) and SSH "
"keys. (For details on how this works, please see the `OpenSSH documentation "
"<http://openssh.org/manual.html>`_.)"

#: ../usage/ssh.rst:21
msgid ""
"The ``paramiko`` library is capable of loading up your ``known_hosts`` file,"
" and will then compare any host it connects to, with that mapping. Settings "
"are available to determine what happens when an unknown host (a host whose "
"username or IP is not found in ``known_hosts``) is seen:"
msgstr ""

#: ../usage/ssh.rst:26
msgid ""
"**Reject**: the host key is rejected and the connection is not made. This "
"results in a Python exception, which will terminate your Fabric session with"
" a message that the host is unknown."
msgstr ""

#: ../usage/ssh.rst:29
msgid ""
"**Add**: the new host key is added to the in-memory list of known hosts, the"
" connection is made, and things continue normally. Note that this does "
"**not** modify your on-disk ``known_hosts`` file!"
msgstr ""

#: ../usage/ssh.rst:32
msgid ""
"**Ask**: not yet implemented at the Fabric level, this is a ``paramiko`` "
"library option which would result in the user being prompted about the "
"unknown key and whether to accept it."
msgstr ""

#: ../usage/ssh.rst:36
msgid ""
"Whether to reject or add hosts, as above, is controlled in Fabric via the "
":ref:`env.reject_unknown_hosts <reject-unknown-hosts>` option, which is "
"False by default for convenience's sake. We feel this is a valid tradeoff "
"between convenience and security; anyone who feels otherwise can easily "
"modify their fabfiles at module level to set ``env.reject_unknown_hosts = "
"True``."

msgid "Known hosts with changed keys"
msgstr "已知主机但更换了密钥"

#: ../usage/ssh.rst:46
msgid ""
"The point of SSH's key/fingerprint tracking is so that man-in-the-middle "
"attacks can be detected: if an attacker redirects your SSH traffic to a "
"computer under his control, and pretends to be your original destination "
"server, the host keys will not match. Thus, the default behavior of SSH (and"
" its Python implementation) is to immediately abort the connection when a "
"host previously recorded in ``known_hosts`` suddenly starts sending us a "
"different host key."
msgstr ""

#: ../usage/ssh.rst:54
msgid ""
"In some edge cases such as some EC2 deployments, you may want to ignore this"
" potential problem. Our SSH layer, at the time of writing, doesn't give us "
"control over this exact behavior, but we can sidestep it by simply skipping "
"the loading of ``known_hosts`` -- if the host list being compared to is "
"empty, then there's no problem. Set :ref:`env.disable_known_hosts <disable-"
"known-hosts>` to True when you want this behavior; it is False by default, "
"in order to preserve default SSH behavior."
msgstr ""

#: ../usage/ssh.rst:63
msgid ""
"Enabling :ref:`env.disable_known_hosts <disable-known-hosts>` will leave you"
" wide open to man-in-the-middle attacks! Please use with caution."
msgstr ""
"启用 :ref:`env.disable_known_hosts <disable-known-hosts>` 会使你暴露在中间人攻击中！"
"请小心使用。"
