msgid "The **core** API is loosely defined as those functions, classes and methods which form the basic building blocks of Fabric (such as `~fabric.operations.run` and `~fabric.operations.sudo`) upon which everything else (the below \"contrib\" section, and user fabfiles) builds."

#: ../index.rst:68
msgid "Fabric's **contrib** package contains commonly useful tools (often merged in from user fabfiles) for tasks such as user I/O, modifying remote files, and so forth. While the core API is likely to remain small and relatively unchanged over time, this contrib section will grow and evolve (while trying to remain backwards-compatible) as more use-cases are solved and added."
